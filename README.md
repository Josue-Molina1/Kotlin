# Rate Exchange calculator

So I wrote this app in order to easy calculate the most common currencies, like the Great British Pounds,
Dollars, Euros and my country's currency, Lempiras. 

I wrote this app with the purpose of understanding API's on Kotlin, which I'm still unable to get, but I 
won't give up, this is just the start of the project. 
I would also like to see what the projection of the different currencies would be in a couple of years.
I would also love to implement a inflation calculator on the different currencies.

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this program were IntelliJ Idea, I got a year license for free for being a student, super nice. 
Anyway, I used that and a lot of Stacks Overflow, I needed to install the Java SDK in order to run programs, so that 
was an important part of it. 

# Useful Websites

This websites were more than helpful:
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/KOTLIN/kotlin_intro.php)
- [Kotlin Website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html#install-kotlin)

# Future Work
A couple of things I need to polish are:
- Use of REST API's 
- Inflation Calculator
- Use of JSON files, well, this is part of the API's, but I want to keep track of the currency history.
- User interface, it'll be cool, doesn't it?
