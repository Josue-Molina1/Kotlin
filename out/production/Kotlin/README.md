# Rate Exchange calculator

So I wrote this app in order to easy calculate the most common currencies, like the Great British Pounds,
Dollars, Euros and my country's currency, Lempiras. 

I wrote this app with the purpose of understanding API's on Kotlin, which I'm still unable to get, but I 
won't give up, this is just the start of the project. 
I would also like to see what the projection of the different currencies would be in a couple of years.
I would also love to implement a inflation calculator on the different currencies.
